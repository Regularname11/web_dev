      <p class="card-text">The oldest of Morocco’s four imperial cities, it was founded on the banks of the Wadi Fès by Idrīs I (east bank, about 789) and Idrīs II (west bank, about 809). 
        The two parts were united by the Almoravids in the 11th century to become a major Islamic city. Fès reached its zenith as a centre of learning and commerce under the Marīnids in the mid-14th century and has kept 
        its religious primacy through the ages. <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Fes">Source</a></p>

      <p>Marrakech gave its name to the kingdom of which it was long the capital. 
        It was founded in the mid-11th century by Yūsuf ibn Tāshufīn of the dynasty of the Almoravids, and it served as the Almoravid capital until it fell to the Almohads in 1147. 
        In 1269 Marrakech passed to the control of the Marīnids, whose preferred capital was the northern city of Fès. 
        Although Marrakech flourished while serving as the capital under the Saʿdīs in the 16th century, the succeeding ʿAlawite rulers resided more often at Fès or Meknès;
         however, the ʿAlawites continued to use Marrakech as a military post. <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Marrakech">Source</a></p>
