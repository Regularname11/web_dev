<h1>About Me</h1>

<hr />
<hr />
<p>I’m Taha-yassine Ennabili, a recent graduate from HÄME University of Applied Sciences.</p><br>

<p>During my years of study at HAMK, I had the opportunity to explore both Business Administration and Information Technology (IT). It
  was during this time that I was introduced to various aspects of web development, data analytics, and business intelligence, which I
  found particularly captivating and enjoyable. Now, I am eager to find an internship or job position where I can further develop my skills
  in these areas and enhance my analytical mindset and problem-solving abilities.
  </p>

<p>Being a student at HAME university of applied sciences, I have had experience with various aspects of the IT field, and multiple
  technologies (Java, JavaScript, C, C++, python, react, HTML, CSS, PHP, etc.). In addition, I had an experience being a game developer for
  one week while participating in a short advanced program (SAP) in Dornbirn, Austria. During this program I had the chance not to
  even know or discover how video games are created but even participate in creating a video games to sensitize people about air
  pollution. We were creating all the game's characters and environment using Unity (C#..) Blender and Maya as well. During the event's
  week, I discovered a lot about the games and gaming industry.

    <p>I recently completed my internship at Hamk smart, the aim of the project is to research different geospatial servers, compare and
      deploy one of them for the Research Unit. using different technologies (Geoserver, Postgre, QGIS, Azure, Docker...). The goal is to
      conduct research on various geospatial servers, compare them, and deploy the selected server for the Research Unit. Tasks involve
      researching and testing existing geospatial software with specific data and usage requirements from the HAMK Smart Research Unit.
      The testing process includes initially conducting tests on a locally hosted version. If deemed suitable for the intended purpose, the
      software is then deployed to the Microsoft Azure cloud environment. Further testing is carried out in the cloud, comparing the
      Windows and Linux host machine operating systems.</p>

      <p>In addition to my academic qualifications. I am also highly self-motivated and dedicated to producing high-quality work, hard worker
        and quick learner.</p>
